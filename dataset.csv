ELECTRIC CHARGES, 
FORCES AND FIELDS
1. INTRODUCTION
You must have felt the attraction of hair of your hand when you bring it near to your Television screen. Did you ever 
think of cause behind it? These all are the electric charges and their properties. Now we will extend our concept to 
electric charges and their efects.
1.1 Nature of Electricity
The atomic structure shows that matter is electrical in nature i.e. matter contains particles of electricity viz. protons 
and electrons. Whether a given body shows electricity (i.e. charge) or not depends upon the relative number of 
these particles in the body.
(a)  If the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in a body, the resultant charge is zero and the 
body will be electrically neutral. For example, the paper of this book is electrically neutral (i.e. exhibits no 
charge) because it has the same number of protons and electrons.
(b)  If from a neutral body, some *electrons are removed, the protons outnumber the electrons. Consequently, the body 
attains a positive charge. Hence, a positively charged body has defcit of electrons from the normal due share.
2. TYPES OF CHARGES
Depending upon whether electrons are removed or added to a body, there are two types of charges viz
(i) Positive charge     (ii) Negative charge
If a glass rod is rubbed with silk, some electrons pass from glass rod to silk. As a result, 
Silk Glass rod
+
+
+
+

the glass rod becomes positively charged and silk attains an equal negative charge as 
shown in Fig. 18.1. It is because silk gains as many electrons as lost by the glass rod. It 
can be shown experimentally that like charges repel each other while unlike charges 
attract each other. In other words, if the two charges are of the same nature (i.e., both 
positive or both negative), the force between them is of repulsion. On the other hand, if 
one charge is positive and the other is negative, the force between them is of attraction. 
The following points may be noted: 
(a)  The charges are not created by the rubbing action. There is merely transfer of electrons from one body to 
another.
(b)  Electrons are transferred from glass rod to silk due to rubbing because we have done external work. Thus law 
of conservation of energy holds.
(c)  The mass of negatively charged silk will increase and that of glass rod will decrease. It is because silk has 
gained electrons while glass rod has lost electrons.

3. PROPERTIES OF CHARGE
(a)  Charge is a scalar quantity
(b)  Charge is transferable
(c)  Charge is conserved
(d)  Charge is quantized
(e)  Like point charges repel each other while unlike point charges attract each other.
(f)  A charged body may attract a neutral body or an oppositely charged body but it always repels a similarly 
charged body
(g)  Note: Repulsion is a sure test of electrifcation whereas attraction may not be.
(h)  Charge is always associated with mass, i.e. charges cannot exist without mass though mass can exist without 
charge.
(i)  Charge is relatively invariant: This means that charge is independent of frame of reference, i.e, charge on a 
body does not change whatever be its speed. This property is worth mentioning as in contrast to charge, the 
mass of a body depends on its speed and increases with increase in speed.
(j)  A charge at rest produces only electric feld around itself; a charge having uniform motion produces electric 
as well as magnetic feld around itself while a charge having acceleration emits electromagnetic radiation also 
in addition to producing electric and magnetic felds.
4. ELECTROSTATICS
The branch of physics which deals with charges at rest is called electrostatics. When a glass rod is rubbed with 
silk and then separated, the former becomes positively charged and the latter attains equal negative charge. It is 
because during rubbing, some electrons are transferred from glass to silk. Since glass rod and silk are separated by 
an insulating medium (i.e. air), they retain the charges. In other words, the charges on them are static or stationary. 
Note that the word ‘electrostatic’ means charges at rest.
5. CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS
In general, the substances are divided into the following two classes on the basis of their ability to conduct electric 
charges:
(a) Conductors: Those substances through which electric charges can fow easily are called conductors e.g., silver, 
copper, aluminum, mercury, etc. In a metallic conductor, there are a large number of free electrons which act as 
charge carries. However, in a liquid conductor, both positive and negative ions are the charge carries. When a 
positively charged body is brought close to or touches a neutral conductor (metallic), the free electrons (charge 
carriers) in the conductor move quickly towards this positive charge. On the other hand, if a negatively charged 
body is brought close to or touches a neutral conductor, the free electrons in the conductor move away from the 
negative charge that is brought close.
(b) Insulators: Those substances through which electric charges cannot fow are called insulators e.g., glass, rubber, 
mica etc. When such materials are charged by rubbing, only the area that is rubbed becomes charged and there is 
no tendency of the charge to move into other regions of the substance. It is because there are practically no free 
electrons in an insulator.
6. CHARGING OF A BODY
A  body  can  be  charged  by  means  of  (a)  friction,  (b)  conduction,  (c)  induction,  (d)  thermionic  ionization,  (e) 
photoelectric efect and (f) feld emission.

them  should  be  insulator)  then  some  electrons  are 
transferred from one body to another. The body which 
gains electrons becomes negatively charged and the 
other becomes positively charged.

(ii)  Insulator  or  Dielectric  or  Nonconductors: 
Materials which do not have free electrons.
When  a  charged  conductor  is  connected  with  a 
neutral conductor, then charge flows from one body 
to another body. In case of two charged conductors, 
charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. 
The charge stops flowing when the potential of the two 
bodies become same.
Note: If two identical shaped conductors kept at large distance are connected to each other, then they will have 
equal charges fnally.

object, then the electrons move to one side and there is excess of 
electrons on that side making it negatively charged and deficiency on 
the other side making that side positively charged. Hence charges 
appear on two sides of the body (although total charge of the body 
is  still  zero).  This  phenomenon  is  called  induction  and  the  charge 
produced by it is called induced charge.
A body can be charged by induction in following two ways.
Method-I: The potential of conductor A becomes zero after earthing.

ejected and the metal gets ionized. It becomes positively charged.

(f) Field emission: When electric field of large magnitude is applied near the 
metal surface then some electrons come out from the metal surface and hence 
the metal gets positively charged. 
7. UNIT OF ELECTRIC CHARGE
We know that a positively charged body has defcit of electrons and a negatively charged body has excess of 
electrons from normal due share. Since the charge on an electron is very small, it is not convenient to select it as the 
unit of charge. In practice, coulomb is used as the unit of charge, i.e., SI unit of charge is coulomb abbreviated as C. 
The charge on one electron in coulomb is =-1.6×10
-19
C
Note that charge on an electron has been found experimentally.
8. QUANTIZATION OF ELECTRIC CHARGE
The charge on an electron (-e=1.6×10
-19
C)
 
or on a proton (+e=+1.6×10
-19
C)
 
is minimum. We know that charge on a 
body is due to loss or gain of electrons by the body. Since a body cannot lose or gain a fraction of an electron, the 
charge on a body must be an integral multiple of electronic charge
e
±
. In other words, charge on a body can only 
be 
q ne
= ±
 where n=1, 2, 3, 4, and e=1.6×10
-19
C. This is called quantization of charge.
The fact that all free charges are integral multiple of electronic charge (e=1.6×10
-19
C) is known as quantization of 
electric charge.
∴
Charge on a body, 
q ne
= ±
Where n=1, 2, 3…….. and e=1.6×10
-19
C
Suppose you measure the charge on a tiny body as +4.5×10
-19
C. This measurement is not correct because measured 
value is not an integral multiple of minimum charge (i.e., 1.6×10
-19
C). 
Note:  (i) The quantization of charge shows that charge is discrete in nature and not of continuous nature.
(ii)  Since  the  charge  on  an  electron  is  so  small  (e=1.6×10
-19
C),  we  normally  do  not  notice  its  discreteness  in 
macroscopic charge (1µC charge requires about 10
13
 electrons) which thus seems continuous.
9. CONSERVATION OF ELECTRIC CHARGE
Just as total linear momentum of an isolated system always remains constant, similarly, the total electric charge 
of an isolated system always remains constant. This is called law of conservation of charge and may be stated as 
under: The total electric charge of an isolated system always remains constant.
In any physical process, the charges may get transferred from one part of the system to the other but total or net 
charge remains the same. In other words, charges can neither be created nor destroyed. No violation of this law 
has ever been found and it is as frmly established as the laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy.

10. RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY OR DIELECTRIC CONSTANT
Permittivity is the property of a medium and afects the magnitude of force between two point charges. Air or vacuum 
has a minimum value of permittivity. The absolute (or actual) permittivity of air or vacuum is

Hence, relative permittivity (or dielectric constant) of a medium may be defined as the ratio of force between two

same distance in the medium.

Comparison of Electrical Force with the Gravitational Force.
(a)  Both electrical and gravitational forces follow the inverse square law.
(b)  Both can act in vacuum also.
(c)  Electrical forces may be attractive or repulsive but gravitational force is always attractive.
(d)  Electrical forces are much stronger than gravitational forces. 
(e)  Both are central as well as conservative forces.
(f)  Both the forces obey Newton’s third law.
11. SUPERPOSITION OF ELECTROSTATIC FORCE
If in a region, more than 2 charges are present, then the net force acting on a particular charge will be the vector 
sum of the individual contribution of all other charges present in region, presence of any other charge in space 
cannot afect the force applied by a particular charge.

12. ELECTRIC FIELD
A charged particle cannot directly interact with another particle kept at a distance. A charge produces something 
called an electric feld in the space around it and this electric feld exerts a force on any other charge (except the 
source charge itself) placed in it.
Thus, the region surrounding a charge or distribution of charge in which its electrical efects can be observed is 
called the electric feld of the charge or distribution of charge. Electric feld at a point can be defned in terms of 
either a vector function 
E

 called ‘electric feld strength’ or a scalar function V called ‘electric potential’. The electric 
feld can also be visualized graphically in terms of ‘lines of force’. The feld propagates through space with the 
speed of light, c. Thus, if a charge is suddenly moved, the force it exerts on another charge a distance r away does 
not change until a time r/c later. In our forgoing discussion we will see that electric feld strength 
E

 and electric 
potential V are interrelated. It is similar to a case where the acceleration, velocity and displacement of a particle are 
related to each other.
12.1 Electric Field Strength 
( )

E
Like its gravitational counterpart, the electric feld strength (often called electric feld) at a point in an electric feld is 
defned as the electrostatic force 
e
F

 per unit positive charge. Thus, if the electrostatic force experienced by a small 
test charge
e
0
q is F

The electric feld is a vector quantity and its direction is the same as the direction of the force 
e
F

 on a positive test 
charge. The SI unit of electric feld is N/C. Here it should be noted that the test charge 
0
q
 does not disturb other 
charges which produces
E

. With the concept of electric feld, our description of electric interactions has two parts. 
First, a given charge distribution acts as a source of electric feld. Second, the electric feld exerts a force on any 
charge that is present in this feld.
An electric feld leads to a force 
Suppose there is an electric feld strength 
E

 at some point in an electric feld, then the electrostatic force acting on 
a charge 
q
+
 is qE in the direction of 
E

, while on the charge –q it is qE in the opposite direction of
E

.
The electric feld at a point is a vector quantity. Suppose 
1


 is the feld at a point due to a charge

 and 
2

is the feld at the same point due to a charge

If the given charges distribution is continuous, we can use the technique of integration to fnd the resultant electric 
feld at a point.

12.4 Electric Field Due to a Ring of Charge
A conducting ring of radius R has a total charge q uniformly distributed over its circumference. We are interested 
in fnding the electric feld at point P that lies on the axis of the ring at a distance x from its center. We divide the 
ring into infnitesimal segments of length dl. Each segment has a charge dq and acts as a point charge source of 
electric feld.

from  all  the  segments  that  make  up  the  ring.  If  we 
consider  two  ring  segments  at  top  and  bottom  of  the 
ring, we see that the contributions 
dE

 to the feld at P 
from these segments have the same x-component but 
opposite y-components. Hence, the total y-component 
of feld due to this pair of segments is zero. When we add 
up the contributions from all such pairs of segments, the 
total feld 
E

 will have only a component along the ring’s 
symmetry  axis  (the  x-axis)  with  no  component 
perpendicular to that axis (i.e. no y or z component). So 
the feld at P is described completely by its x component

13. ELECTRIC FIELD LINES
An electric line of force is an imaginary smooth curve in an electric feld along which a free, isolated unit positive 
charge moves.
Properties
(a)  Electric lines of force start at a positive and terminate at a negative charge.
(b)  A tangent to a line of force at any point gives the direction of the force on positive charge and hence direction 
of electric feld at that point.
(c)  No two lines of force can intersect one another.
(d)  The lines of force are crowded in the region of larger intensity and further apart in the region of weak feld.
(e)  Lines of force leave the surface of a conductor normally.
(f)  Electric lines of force do not pass through a closed conductor.

(b)  Two equal positive charges (Fig18.20 (c))- the 
feld  lines  around  a  system  of  two  positive

of their mutual repulsion.
(c)  Two  equal  and  opposite  charges  (Fig18.20

show  clearly  the  mutual  attraction  between

charge and terminate at

. If there is only one negative charge then lines 
start from

 and terminate at negative charge.
(b)  The  electric  intensity  at  a  point  is  the  number  of  lines  of  force  streaming 
through per unit area normal to the direction of the intensity at that point. 
The intensity will be more where the density of lines is more. 
(c)  Number of lines originating (terminating) from (on) is directly proportional 
to the magnitude of the charge.
Note: A charge particle need not follow an Electric feld lines.
(a)  Electric feld lines of resultant electric feld can never intersect with each other.
(b)  Electric feld lines produced by static charges do not form close loop.
(c)  Electric feld lines end or start perpendicularly on the surface of a conductor.
(d)  Electric feld lines never enter in to conductors.

   (JEE MAIN) 
Sol: Use properties of feld lines.   
The basic concept of this question is that number density is directly proportional 
to electric feld. If we take the entire area of the sphere around the charge, then 
area will be the same. Now, we just have to count the number of lines originating 
from the two charges.

The number of electric feld lines that penetrates a given surface is called an “electric 
fux,” which we denote as 
E
Φ
. The electric feld can therefore be thought of as the 
number of lines per unit area.
In Fig. 18.23 shows Electric field lines passing through a surface of area A.
Consider  the  surface  shown  in  Fig.  18.24.  Let 
ˆ
A An

be  defined  as  the  area  vector 
having  a  magnitude  of  the  area  of  the  surface,  A,  and  pointing  in  the  normal

Note that with the defnition for the normal vector

, the electric fux 
E

 is positive if 
the electric feld lines are leaving the surface, and negative if entering the surface.
In general, a surface S can be curved and the electric field 
E

 may vary over the surface. 
We shall be interested in the case where the surface is closed. A closed surface is a 
surface which completely encloses a volume. In order to compute the electric flux, we 
divide the surface into a large number of infinitesimal area elements

Illustration 8: An infnitely long rod of negligible radius has a uniform 
charge density
λ
. Calculate the electric feld at a distance r from the wire. 
  (JEE MAIN)
Sol: We shall solve the problem by following the steps outlined above. 
 
 
(a)  An infnitely long rod possesses cylindrical symmetry.
(b)  The charge density is uniformly distributed throughout the length, 
and the electric feld E

must point radially away from the symmetry 
axis of the rod (Fig. 18.34). The magnitude of the electric feld is 
constant on cylindrical surface of radius r. Therefore, we choose a 
coaxial cylinder as our Gaussian surface.
(c)  Field lines for an infnite uniformly charged rod (the symmetry axis 
of the rod and the Gaussian cylinder are perpendicular to plane of 
the page.)
(d)  The amount of charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface, a cylinder 
of radius r and length 

 (Fig. 18.35), is 
enc
q = λ
.
(e)  As  indicated  in  Fig.  18.36,  the  Gaussian  surface  consists  of  three 
parts: a two ends S

 and S

 plus the curved side wall S

The result is in complete agreement with that obtained in equation 
using Coulomb’s law. Notice that the result is independent of the 
length 

 of the cylinder, and only depends on the inverse of the 
distance r from the symmetry axis. The qualitative behavior of E as a 
function of r is plotted in Fig. 18.36.
Illustration  9:  Consider  an  infnitely  large  non-conduction  plane  in  the  xy-plane  with  uniform  surface  charge 
density σ . Determine the electric feld everywhere in space.   (JEE MAIN)
Sol: (i) An infnitely large plane possesses a planar symmetry. 
(ii) Since the charge is uniformly distributed on the surface, the electric 
feld 
E

must  point  perpendicularly  away  from  the  plane, 
ˆ
E Ek
=

.  The 
magnitude of the electric feld is constant on planes parallel to the non-
conducting plane.
We choose our Gaussian surface to be a cylinder, which is often referred 
to as a “pillbox”
The pillbox also consists of three parts: two end-caps S
1 
and S
2
, and a 
curved side S
3
.
(ii) Since the surface charge distribution is uniform, the charge enclosed 
by the Gaussian “pillbox” is
enc
q A
= σ
, where A=A
1
=A
2
 is the area of the 
end-caps.

the total fux can be rewritten as

SOLVING TACTICS
The following steps may be useful when applying Gauss’s law:
(a)  Identify the symmetry associated with the charge distribution.
(b)  Determine the direction of the electric feld, and a “Gaussian surface” on which the magnitude of the electric 
feld is constant over portions of the surface.
(c)  Divide the space into diferent regions associated with the charge distribution. For each region, calculate
enc
q
, the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface.
(d)  Calculate the electric fux 
E
Φ
through the Gaussian surface for each region.
(e)  Equate 
E
Φ
with
enc
q /
ο
ε
, and deduce the magnitude of the electric feld.
In this chapter, we have discussed how electric feld can be calculated for both the discrete and continuous charge 
distributions. For the former, we apply the superposition principle:

, Electric Charges, Forces, and Fields
1. Nature of Electricity

All matter contains protons (positive) and electrons (negative).

A body is neutral if protons = electrons; it becomes charged if this balance is disturbed (loss/gain of electrons).

2. Types of Charges

Two types: Positive (loss of electrons) and Negative (gain of electrons).

Like charges repel; unlike charges attract.

Charges are transferred, not created, during rubbing (e.g., glass rod and silk).

3. Properties of Charge

Scalar, transferable, conserved, quantized (exists in discrete amounts), and always associated with mass.

Repulsion is a definite test for charge; attraction can happen with neutral objects too.

Charge is invariant with speed, unlike mass.

4. Electrostatics

Studies charges at rest.

Example: Rubbing glass with silk produces static charges.

5. Conductors and Insulators

Conductors (e.g., metals): Allow easy flow of charges due to free electrons.

Insulators (e.g., glass, rubber): Do not allow charge flow; only the rubbed area is charged.

6. Charging Methods

Friction: Transfer of electrons by rubbing.

Conduction: Direct transfer of charge by contact.

Induction: Redistribution of charges without direct contact.

Thermionic emission: Heating ejects electrons.

Photoelectric effect: Light causes electron emission.

Field emission: Strong electric field pulls out electrons.

7. Unit and Quantization of Charge

SI unit: Coulomb (C). Charge on one electron: -1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.

Charge is quantized: Only integral multiples of electron charge are possible.

8. Conservation of Charge

Total charge in an isolated system remains constant; charges can neither be created nor destroyed.

9. Coulomb’s Law (Electrostatic Force)

Force between two charges is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Like charges repel; unlike charges attract.

10. Relative Permittivity (Dielectric Constant)

Measures how a medium reduces the force between charges compared to air/vacuum.

Force in a medium = Force in air / Dielectric constant (K).

K = 1 for air/vacuum; >1 for other materials.

11. Superposition Principle

Net force on a charge is the vector sum of forces from all other charges.

In essence:
The lecture covers the basics of electric charge, its properties, how objects become charged, types of materials, fundamental laws governing electric forces, and the effects of different media on electric interactions.
