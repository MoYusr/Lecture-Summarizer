Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. 
It focuses on building systems that learn from data. 
Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms. 
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. 
Neural networks are inspired by the human brain structure. 
Backpropagation is key for training neural networks.
